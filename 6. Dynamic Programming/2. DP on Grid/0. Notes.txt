Patterns:

    1. Fixed starting point and fixed ending point
    2. Fixed starting point and variable ending point.
    3. Variable starting point and variable ending point.

Steps:

	1. Express everything in terms of (i,j).
	2. Write base case.
	3. Explore all paths.
	4. Find max/min/feasible of all the paths.

Points to remember:

	1. Base cases -> destination or out of bound cases
	2. Always write out of bound base case first and then destination base case.
    When maximum is asked - corner cases returns minimum and vice versa.
