  *  Array/String + Subarray/Substring + largest/max/min + k (window size)
    - Window size formula: [end - start + 1]

    Types of Sliding Window:
    1. Fixed Size
    2. Variable Size


      Fixed Size
        • window size given - maximize sum.
        • Once window size is achieved - get an answer. - [ if(size==k) -> candidate for answer]
        • Window size is maintained

        while(end<size)
        {
                Calculations
                if(windowSize<k) end++;
                else if(windowSize == k){
                        Ans <--- from calculations
                        Calculations - remove start
                        Window size maintained and slide
                }
        }



      Variable Size:
        • Sum given - find max/min window[largest window/smallest window - subjected to a condition]d
        • Once condition is achieved - get an answer. - [ if(sum==k) -> candidate for answer]
        • Window size will vary.


            while (j < size) {
                // Perform necessary calculations
                if (condition < k) {
                    j++;
                } else {
                    // Update answer from calculations
                    // Remove calculation for i
                    if (condition == k) {
                        j++;
                    } else {
                        while (condition > k) {
                            // Remove calculation for i
                            i++;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }





🔹 When to Use HashMap?

Use a HashMap in sliding window problems when:

    You need to track frequencies of elements dynamically (e.g., counting occurrences of characters/numbers).
    Elements can appear multiple times and you must track how many times they appear.
    You need quick lookups (O(1) average case) for checking if a certain condition (e.g., uniqueness) is met.
