/*
 * The intuition behind the top view is similar to vertical order traversal, where nodes are grouped by their vertical lines (horizontal distances). 
 * However, instead of considering all nodes at each vertical line, the top view only includes the first node encountered for each line during a level-order traversal (BFS). 
 * This ensures that only the topmost nodes from each vertical line are visible. A TreeMap is used to maintain the vertical order, ensuring the nodes are retrieved in left-to-right order for the result.
 */

 /*
  * Time Complexity:
        BFS traversal visits each node once: O(N).
        Insertion into the TreeMap for vertical lines takes 
            O(logK) per node, where K is the number of vertical lines.
        Overall: O(NlogN) in the worst case (as Kâ‰¤N).
    Space Complexity:
        Space for the queue and TreeMap is O(N) in total, as both are bounded by the number of nodes.


/*
    
    Top View: Adds a node only if the vertical line is not yet in the map.
    Bottom View: Updates the map entry for every node encountered at a vertical line.
