# Two Pointers Algorithm

Overview:-

The two pointers technique is a common algorithmic approach used to solve problems involving arrays or lists. 
It involves using two pointers to iterate through the data structure, often from different ends, to find a solution efficiently.

When to Use:-

- When you need to find pairs in an array that satisfy a certain condition.
- When you need to reverse a sequence or part of it.
- When you need to partition an array based on a condition.
- When you need to find subarrays with certain properties.

Common Problems :-

1. Pair Sum: Finding pairs in a sorted array that sum up to a specific target.
2. Container With Most Water: Finding the maximum area of water that can be contained.
3. Remove Duplicates: Removing duplicates from a sorted array in-place.
4. Palindrome Check: Checking if a string is a palindrome by comparing characters from both ends.



Example
* Pair Sum Problem
    Given a sorted array `arr` and a target sum `target`, find two numbers in the array that add up to `target`.
